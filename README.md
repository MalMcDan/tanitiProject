# tanitiProject

This website was made for a User Experience project with WGU. I was asked to create a website for the island of Taniti that would serve the purpose for the user persona created based on survey data. 
The website prototype features simple navigation for the user to look for booking information, find out more about the island and be able to determine what currency and electrical adapters are needed.
